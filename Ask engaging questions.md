Most of my positive experiences with my personal social media account has been asking open-ended questions to my [[Furry Music]] audience.

This is partially because asking an open-ended personal question invites a type of relationship that the audience doesn't usually get to invoke on social media.

## How not to do it

"What is your favourite way to eat our new chicken sandwich?" is not an engaging question. It presumes too much. It provides too much information while asking for people's input.

People will rightfully feel like they are not being given a choice to interact in-line with what the post is asking.

It assumes people even like the new chicken sandwich. You're bound to get stronger backlash from a post like this than if you worded it more broadly, and provided the info of "new chicken sandwich" more organically in converation.

## How you *could* do it

"What's your favourite thing to get from our menu?"

> chicken sandwich

"Chicken sandwich is our favourite too!"
or
"That's a new one, glad to see it's caught on!"

In this way it at least makes it feel more conversational as your provide information. It's less obviously trying to advertise itself to you.

## Allow vulnerability and negative input

Most people do not want to "engage" with a brand account. Merely crossing the streams between a brand and a real personal community is usually seen as an intrusion on that community space.

Brands should either embrace the fact that they speak from an authoritative position, or make efforts to make their communications more personified and identifiable

If the post provides opportunities for **vulnerability**, on both sides of the conversation, then users feel more comfortable to bring out an inner truth and to share their opinions, rather than merely promoting a thin message as lead by the brand. You may not get roaring positivity from the audience, but they will feel like your presence is less invasive and fa√ßade-ful.

If the equal opportunity for both positive comment and negative comment arises, then people feel more enticed to act on their sleeve, rather than to feel pressured to be positive or negative. Just keep an eye on what people are saying and if something is skewing in one way or another, as people tend to respond with whatever they feel like is the right move for the room.
