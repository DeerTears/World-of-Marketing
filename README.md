# Welcome to the World of Marketing!

This is an obsidian vault, [install Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and load this vault to see it in full, complete with proper internal links.

Anyway, hi! This is my personal journal where I document everything I've learned about writing for an audience.

Despite the name, this notebook not only covers **marketing**, but also:
- technical writing
- copywriting
- fiction writing (rare)
- citing

Within the realm of marketing I hope to take sufficient notes in the following topics as I bolster my skills:
- [[Copywriting]]
- [[SEO Optimization]]
- [[Keyword Research]]
- Maintaining a [[Brand Voice]] for multiple brands

I may also talk about my experiences doing some of this work for organizations that I'm a part of when it becomes useful to mention a real-world example.
