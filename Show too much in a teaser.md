People rarely get excited by being told to expect something big with no follow-up information.

## With an established audience

This is a great tweet by the old label social media runner for [[trickyStoop North]], because most of the musicians in this space are identifiable by their images, but to those completely unfamiliar this is nothing special. It understates its effectiveness with a simple body: "tsN-004", and lets the cropped image do the rest of the talking. People like to speculate about what the next thing could be.

This gives away too much information to someone knowledgeable, but not enough away that it's told right-away to the uninformed viewer. This is the perfect teaser.
## Without an established audience

But what if you have no established audience or "experts"? You should then **lean forward** and to **show too much information**, to let people learn more about the thing and get invested, just without giving them the whole package.

Just keep in mind what you are allowed to show in full, and what constitutes copyright infringement.

For example, I showed many of the biggest hits and pieces of the songs off my latest (as of writing) album [[WANNABE]], in a preview video that let people scope the sound of the album before listening. I gave what I thought was "giving too much away" but ultimately I think it served it better as it let people who hadn't heard it yet get more invested in the sound.
