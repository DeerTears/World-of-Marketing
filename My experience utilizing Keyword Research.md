Try this with [[trickyStoop North]]! Or [[indieAnthro]] blogging!

See what content keywords come up when doing [[Keyword Research]] in relation to [[Furry Music]] and use that as something to drive the landing page of the main label's website!

Then rephrase those keywords into questions, and see if there can't be an article written about that combination of keyword and question phrasing!

How did it go?

Well...there's not a lot about Furry Music being searched. Furry is being searched. At best though most related keywords being suggested are merely addition to "music", such as "music video", "music playlist", "music download".

But good to know that the only question recommended was "What is Furry Music" which seems to be picked up well by search engines. I've been able to find my own website just by searching furry music, so something's working, it seems. Which is good. I should consider updating the website again. ðŸ¤”
