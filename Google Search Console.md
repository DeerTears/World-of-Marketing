Google Searh Console is a webtool that can check your website's performance in Google, determine its keyword strength, as well as provide some mild security checks.

If your site appears to be hacked, provides malicious links, or steals user information, and is at risk of being blocked by google. Google will alert you of this as something your webmaster can address.

Google recommends only checking your site with google console once a month.
