A way I've found to keep regularly posting about stuff in the past has been to [[Provide reviews and recaps on recent events]]. This is one example of that.

Reason: Friend hell is not a [[trickyStoop North]] labelmate, I should focus on tSN labelmates.

Only issue is that no tSN labelmates have any tapes left in stock, so when we do get another run done it'd be nice to provide a post like this about the artist. Perhaps with a design that includes information in the image instead of text! This an example of trying to [[Provide an image or video where possible]], where the text has the information but the image at least gets people's attention and stands out more.
